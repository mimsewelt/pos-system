# POS Branch Management System (FastAPI)

This is a modular and secure backend system for managing supermarket branches. Built with **FastAPI**, it focuses on scalability, maintainability, and extensibility — with the goal of integrating AI capabilities in the future.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create and manage branches (Filialen)
- ✅ Modular architecture (routes, models, DB, security)
- ✅ JWT-ready authentication structure
- ✅ FastAPI Swagger documentation
- ✅ Ready for SQLite (switchable to PostgreSQL/MySQL later)
- 🔒 Designed with security and future AI integration in mind
